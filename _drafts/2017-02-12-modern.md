In trying to be serious about Heidegger, I incline to be more serious about Wittgenstein, at least I find something to do with this once attempted seriousness. Yes, it is not the regular case of mentioning the two great, that is, greatest, philosophers of the 20th. Leaving aside of ourselves the problem with this great which is soon, always too soon to become greatest, from the side of the individual person so speaking, into one, into a group, and in the end into himself as a title of life wrongly spent, and not even mentioning the marketing thing of the market as a de facto signification of the vulgar (1)To begin with, I think how much the commentaries about Heidegger, the new mode of writing about, by way of a dictionary of the great philosopher’s philosophy, whether the title is a shamelessly, A Dictionary of x’s Philosophy, or perhaps with no less audacity and, hopefully, with a greater sense of the philosophical, where it is somewhat the same without the title. Dealing with this apparently strange phenomenon regarding Heidegger, the other show of it lies in the fact that the reading of one commentary about Heidegger- mainly his known as a must-be and must-be as masterpiece, Being and Time, is like reading all the others, in the sense of a well-nigh the same running commentary, free from intimations towards dialectics, or anything of wonder, but the wonder of how this is said, and much less of what is being said from the first place- is to actually READ pretty much the reading of most of the commentaries which you must read, and the studies which you must walk through. But what between this and Wittgenstein? Well, on the face of it, it appears that the mountains of commentaries, moving to the same, as first and foremost preoccupied with the elaboration or invented words or what is the same thing, words that get a new meaning, from some historical Greek force, as related to the so-called possibility laying before the German speaking philosopher- well, on the face of it, it appears that the whole thing defies the contention of Wittgenstein, according to which private language is meaningless. It is meaningless, unless the indoctrination of the academic world, in its pursuit after more ways to busy the mind without heart, is fascinated with the foreign, better yet German (it is the more serious side of things, traditionally; also, it is the serious side of the americium fascination out of the French Charlatans of 20th philosophy, headed by Derrida) the never baked enough to show the absurd, or easily baked prime and again as a way to push away the original absurd, while obstructing it with another version as a beetle-browed, second version of the same pile-machinery of the first engine.
